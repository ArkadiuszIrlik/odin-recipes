    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>sauce</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>szechuan peppercorn</li>
        <li>veggies</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Szechuan chicken is best prepared using chicken breasts cut into cubes. Also, we like to marinate the chicken in a mixture of seasonings with cornstarch. This takes some additional time, but it is definitely worth it. However, if you are short on time, then skip the marinade part.</li>
        <li>The seasonings include rice wine, soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil. These alone make the meat super tasty. After marinating, fry the chicken until cooked evenly on both sides.</li>
        <li>Next, in a large skillet, over medium-high heat, stir fry the vegetables. Simply add in minced garlic, ginger, chilies, bell peppers, scallions (or green onions), nuts, and the famous Szechuan peppercorn.
        </li>
        <li>After a few minutes, toss in the fried chicken to combine with the rest of the ingredients. Remove from heat, garnish with sesame seeds, scallions, and more chili peppers!</li>
        <li>Serve with rice and youâ€™ve got yourself a complete savory meal of carbs, protein, and fiber.</li>
    </ol>
